liquidgastoken doesnt use decimals. remove the /100.0

i like the features coming from OpenZeppelin, but they take more gas than if I wrote them myself (especially with the GSN checking code)

do we want to keep using kollateral? using dydx directly is free and has plenty of liquidity for us
- what about uniswap flash loans?
