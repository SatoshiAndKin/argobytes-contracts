Each summoner starts with 32 points
Each attribute starts with a base of 8
Increasing from 9–14 costs 1 point each
Increasing from 15–16 costs 2 points each
Increasing from 17-18 costs 3 points each
Increasing to 19-20 costs 4 points each


A summoner receives 1 additional point every 4 levels, at 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.
